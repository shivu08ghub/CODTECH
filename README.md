## Objective of the Project

### Project: STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION on APPLE Inc.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive analysis of historical stock market data for Apple Inc. to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations that impact stock prices, develop predictive models using time series analysis techniques such as ARIMA or LSTM to forecast future stock prices accurately.

### Key Activities
- **Data Collection:** Gather historical stock market data for Apple Inc. from reliable sources like Yahoo Finance.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanse and preprocess the data, handling missing values, adjusting for splits and dividends, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations using statistical methods and visualizations.
- **Model Building:** Implement time series forecasting models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict future stock prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE),
